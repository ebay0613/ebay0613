- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @ebay0613

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code including web and app development, music production, learning languages

- 🌱 I’m currently a beginner learning Python and JavaScript and will hopefully learn Bash and dabble in C++ later.

- 💜 I’m looking to collaborate on some personal projects if more experienced people are willing to help out a beginner and answer some potentially silly questions (from their perspective).

- 📫  Reach me via email at genderfluidarmy@duck.com.

- 😊 Pronouns: he/they/she (in order of preference)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I play sled hockey.
